Use
====

Supysonic exposes only a [Subsonic](http://subsonic.org/) compatible interface
and thus it can by only used through apps that can connect to the API. I enjoy
supysonic using
[DSub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=github.daneren2005.dsub) on
Android
([github repo with apks](https://github.com/daneren2005/Subsonic/releases)) and
[Jamstash](http://www.jamstash.com/) on the web.
